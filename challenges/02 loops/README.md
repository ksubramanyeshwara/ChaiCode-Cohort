You have a basket full of apples. You need to count how many apples are in the basket, but you donâ€™t know the exact number. Each time you pick an apple, you count one. Your task is to count how many apples are in the basket.

Create a function that counts the number of apples in the basket using a loop.

[Chocolate Box Count](./03-chocolate-box-count.js)

You're packing chocolate bars into gift boxes. Each box needs to have the same number of chocolate bars. You need to find out how many boxes of chocolates you'll have after packing the bars.

[Total Water](./04-total-water.js)

You're preparing for a picnic and need to fill several water bottles. Each bottle requires a different amount of water, but you're going to fill them one by one. How do you track the amount of water you're adding to each bottle?

Create a function that takes an array of water amounts (in liters) for each bottle and adds them up. The function should return the total amount of water you've filled in all the bottles.
